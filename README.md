# Java_Basics

This repository has code which implements the basic logics and concepts in java

ENCAPSULATION

encapsulation is the bundling of data belonging to a class and wrapping it so that it cannot be accessed by other classes.

ABSTRACTION

Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.

INHERITANCE

Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

POLYMORPHISM

polymorphism is the use of similar methods differently on the basis of classes or the conditions for the method to be met and respectively changes the attributes of the object.

MULTITHREADING

Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread.

EXCEPTION HANDLING

Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved.

STREAMING

Introduced in Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.

FILE HANDLING

In Java, with the help of File Class, we can work with files. This File Class is inside the java.io package. The File class can be used by creating an object of the class and then specifying the name of the file.

JAVA SWING AND APPLET

Applet and Swing are used to develop window-based applications in Java.
